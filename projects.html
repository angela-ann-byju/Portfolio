        Welcome to my project showcase! Here you can explore some of the creative designs I have worked on
        using tools like <strong>Figma</strong> and <strong>Canva</strong>. Each project represents a step in
        my journey of learning design, creativity, and visual storytelling.

<h2>Poster & Design Works</h2>
<section>
    <p>
        These posters were my initial explorations into design using Canva. Through these works, I learned
        about layout, balance, typography, and expressing ideas visually.
