            <p>
                I’m a B.Tech Computer Science student at Amal Jyothi College of Engineering with a strong interest in 
                technology and design. I enjoy creating clean, functional, and user-friendly digital experiences.
                My focus is on learning how real-world problems can be solved through code and creative thinking.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also worked as a Web Development Intern at Cognifyz, where I gained hands-on experience building
                responsive websites and understanding industry practices. This internship helped me improve my development 
                skills and learn to work in a professional environment.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m passionate about exploring new technologies and continuously improving myself. Every project is an 
                opportunity to learn, grow, and create something meaningful.
